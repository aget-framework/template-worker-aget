# AGET: CLI Agent Template

> **Mission: Help CLI-using creators to build better software enjoyably faster (using CLI coding agents)**

**Agent Template (AGET)** - Cognitive augmentation framework for software and data work. Transform any project into a CLI agent-ready environment with conversational command patterns. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, and all major AI coding assistants.

**Current Version**: v2.1.0

## Branch Strategy
- **main branch**: Stable release (v2.1.0)
- **develop branch**: Next features (v2.2.0)
- See [.aget/BRANCHING.md](.aget/BRANCHING.md) for details

> **📍 Strategic Vision & Governance**: Vision and governance documents now live in [aget-aget](https://github.com/aget-framework/aget). This repository focuses on stable implementation. See [GOVERNANCE_POINTER.md](docs/GOVERNANCE_POINTER.md) for details.

## Who This Is For

- **Software Owners** governing their project's evolution
- **Contributors** needing private workspace for external projects
- **Analysts** examining codebases without modifying
- **Data Scientists** organizing standalone analysis (Spotify, financial, etc.)
- **Developers** wanting consistent patterns across projects
- **Learners** using AI to understand and build software

## What This Provides

AGET implements a specification-driven development framework with:
- **Spec templates**: Define what you want before building
- **Session management**: `hey` → work → `wind down` → `sign off`
- **AI interaction**: Natural language commands that work consistently
- **Progressive understanding**: Start empty, grow knowledge over time
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with all major AI assistants

## Quick Start (30 Seconds)

### How AGET Works

AGET is not a traditional CLI tool. You interact through your AI assistant using natural language:

1. **Clone AGET** into your project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aget-framework/aget.git
cd aget-cli-agent-template
```

2. **Open with your AI assistant**:
```bash
claude .  # or: cursor . | aider . | windsurf .
```

3. **Start with natural language**:
```
You: hey
AI: [Checks environment, reports status, ready for commands]

You: initialize this as an agent project
AI: [Sets up agent structure with workspace/, products/, docs/]

You: create a Python scraper tool
AI: [Builds tool in workspace/, adds tests, documentation]
```

### Behind the Scenes

Your AI assistant discovers and uses AGET patterns automatically. You never type `aget` commands directly - the AI handles that based on your natural language requests.

For more installation options and customization, see [docs/GET_STARTED.md](docs/GET_STARTED.md)

## 🚀 Try It Now! (2 Minutes)

Experience AGET with your AI assistant immediately:

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the template
git clone https://github.com/aget-framework/aget.git
cd aget-cli-agent-template

# 2. Open with your AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
claude .  # or: cursor . | code . | aider

# 3. Tell your AI assistant:
"hey"
```

Your AI will respond with project status, available patterns, and be ready for natural language commands like:
- `"run tests"` - Execute test suite
- `"check documentation"` - Analyze docs quality
- `"tidy up"` - Clean temporary files
- `"wind down"` - Save session and commit

### Live Example Session

```
You: hey

AI: Good morning! Let me check your environment...
    ✓ Working directory: ~/aget-cli-agent-template
    ✓ Git status: On branch main, clean
    ✓ Python version: 3.11.5
    ✓ Available patterns: 15 installed
    Ready for your commands!

You: let's build a Python web scraper tool

AI: I'll help you create a web scraper. Let me start by creating the project structure...
    [Creates workspace/scraper.py with requests and BeautifulSoup]
    ✓ Created main scraper module
    ✓ Added error handling and rate limiting
    ✓ Included user-agent headers
    Shall I add tests?

You: yes, and make it installable

AI: Creating package structure...
    [Creates setup.py, requirements.txt, tests/]
    ✓ Package structure created
    ✓ Unit tests added (3 passing)
    ✓ Installation tested successfully
    You can now: pip install -e .

You: wind down

AI: Saving session...
    ✓ Created session notes: SESSION_NOTES/2025-09-28.md
    ✓ Committed changes: "feat: Add hello world example"
    Session duration: 2 minutes
    Have a great day!
```

## Installation

> **⚠️ Important**: AGET is not a traditional CLI tool. You don't run `aget` commands directly. Instead, your AI assistant uses AGET patterns based on your natural language requests.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic command-line familiarity

### Method 1: Clone and Use Directly (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/aget-framework/aget.git

# Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/your-project

# Run aget commands using Python module syntax
python3 /path/to/aget-cli-agent-template/aget/__main__.py init
```

### Method 2: Create Alias for Convenience
Add to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
```bash
alias aget="python3 /path/to/aget-cli-agent-template/aget/__main__.py"
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can use:
```bash
aget init
aget validate
aget list
```

## Usage

> **Note**: The commands below are what your AI assistant can execute behind the scenes. You interact through natural language like "hey", "initialize this", "run tests", not by typing these commands.

### Core Commands (AI Executes These)

#### Initialize a New Agent
```bash
# Create agent with standard patterns (recommended)
aget init --template agent --with-patterns

# Create tool with minimal patterns
aget init --template tool --with-patterns minimal

# Create hybrid agent/tool
aget init --template hybrid --with-patterns advanced
```

#### Validate Your Setup
```bash
# Check if your project meets AGET standards
aget validate

# Detailed validation with recommendations
aget validate --verbose
```

#### List Available Patterns
```bash
# Show all available patterns
aget list

# Show installed patterns
aget list --installed

# Show patterns by category
aget list --category session
```

#### Extract Tools to Products
```bash
# Extract a tool from workspace to products
aget extract --from workspace/my_tool.py --to products/

# Extract with dependencies
aget extract --from workspace/analyzer.py --to products/ --with-deps
```

### Session Management Commands
Your AI assistant will understand these natural language commands:

- **`hey`** or **`wake up`** - Start a session, check status
- **`wind down`** or **`save work`** - Save session with detailed notes
- **`sign off`** or **`all done`** - Quick save and exit
- **`tidy up`** - Clean temporary files
- **`deep clean`** - Archive old files and reorganize
- **`health check`** - Run diagnostics when something's wrong

### Working with Patterns
```bash
# Install a specific pattern
python3 patterns/session/session_manager.py --install

# Run a pattern directly
python3 patterns/housekeeping/cleanup.py --dry-run

# Check pattern documentation
python3 patterns/documentation/check_docs.py --help
```

## Why Universal Standards?

### The Configuration Fragmentation Problem

The current landscape of AI coding assistants creates configuration overhead. Each tool requires its own format:

- **Claude Code**: Reads `CLAUDE.md` for agent-specific instructions
- **Cursor**: Requires `.cursorrules` for behavior configuration
- **Windsurf**: Uses `.windsurfrules` for custom patterns
- **Aider**: Expects `.aider.conf.yml` for settings
- **GitHub Copilot**: Uses `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

This fragmentation means maintaining multiple configuration files with duplicated content. Using multiple tools requires synchronizing changes across 3-5 different formats.

## What You Get

After installation, your CLI agent can understand commands like:

- **`hey`** - Initialize session with project status
- **`tidy up`** - Clean temporary files and caches
- **`deep clean`** - Deep cleanup with archiving
- **`check docs`** - Analyze documentation quality
- **`health check`** - Emergency diagnostics when something's wrong
- **`save work`** - Save session state and commit changes
- **`all done`** - Quick commit and push

## Features

✅ **Natural Language Commands** - Conversational interface for common tasks
✅ **Progressive Safety** - Dry-run → Modify → Reorganize
✅ **Session Management** - Context preservation across conversations
✅ **Emergency Recovery** - Diagnostic and recovery protocols
✅ **Documentation as Code** - Quality checks and auto-fixes
✅ **Git Integration** - Smart commits, checkpoints, and rollbacks

## How It Works

1. **Agent reads AGENTS.md** - Discovers available conversational command patterns
2. **Pattern discovery** - Agent automatically identifies workflow patterns from configuration
3. **Natural language triggers** - You say "hey", agent executes the corresponding pattern
4. **Safe-by-default** - Dry-run previews, rollback support, confirmation prompts
5. **Session persistence** - Context preservation across agent restarts

## Examples

### Starting a Session
```
You: hey
Agent: Running wake protocol...
       ✓ Working directory: ~/project
       ✓ Git status: 3 uncommitted changes
       ✓ Tests: 47 passing
       ✓ Documentation: Grade B
       Ready for tasks.
```

### Cleaning Up
```
You: spring clean
Agent: Running spring clean protocol (dry-run)...
       Would archive 5 old session notes
       Would remove 127 __pycache__ files
       Would clean 3.2MB temp files
       Run without --dry-run to execute.
```

### Emergency Recovery
```
You: sanity check
Agent: Running emergency diagnostics...
       ✓ Python 3.11.0
       ✓ Git repository OK
       ✓ Critical files present
       ✓ Imports working
       System Status: OK
```

1. Fork and clone
2. Say "hey" to your CLI agent
3. Make changes following existing patterns
4. Say "test templates" to run tests
5. Say "wind down" to save your session
6. Submit a pull request

## Pattern Development

To add a new pattern:

1. Create in `patterns/<category>/<pattern_name>.py`
2. Add tests in `tests/test_<pattern_name>.py`
3. Document in `patterns/<category>/README.md`
4. Update the installer to include it

## Versioning

This project uses semantic versioning. Each pattern has its own version number, allowing selective updates.
