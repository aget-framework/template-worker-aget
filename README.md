# AGET: CLI Agent Template

> **Mission: Help software creators achieve their vision with AI**

**Agent Template (AGET)** - Cognitive augmentation framework for software and data work. Transform any project into a CLI agent-ready environment with conversational command patterns. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, and all major AI coding assistants.

**v2.0 Expansion**: AGET now supports five cognitive modalities - from standalone data analysis to meta-governance of multiple projects.

> **📍 Strategic Vision & Governance**: Vision and governance documents now live in [aget-aget](https://github.com/aget-framework/aget). This repository focuses on stable implementation. See [GOVERNANCE_POINTER.md](GOVERNANCE_POINTER.md) for details.

## Who This Is For

- **Software Owners** governing their project's evolution
- **Contributors** needing private workspace for external projects
- **Analysts** examining codebases without modifying
- **Data Scientists** organizing standalone analysis (Spotify, financial, etc.)
- **Teams** wanting consistent AI collaboration patterns
- **Learners** using AI to understand and build software

## What This Provides

AGET implements a specification-driven development framework with:
- **Spec templates**: Define what you want before building
- **Session management**: `hey` → work → `wind down` → `sign off`
- **AI collaboration**: Specs become the contract with your AI partner
- **Progressive understanding**: Start empty, grow knowledge over time
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with all major AI assistants

## Quick Start (30 Seconds)

```bash
# Clone and install AGET in your project
git clone https://github.com/aget-framework/aget.git
cd aget-cli-agent-template
python3 installer/install.py /path/to/your/project

# Or use the new aget commands (v2 Enhanced):
aget init --template agent --with-patterns  # One-command complete setup!

# Tell your AI: "hey"
# AI responds with project status and is ready to work

# Extract your libraries:
aget extract --from src/ --to products/ --name my-library

# That's it! Your project is now AI-agent ready
```

## Why Universal Standards?

### The Configuration Fragmentation Problem

The current landscape of AI coding assistants has created a significant maintenance burden for development teams. Each tool requires its own configuration format:

- **Claude Code**: Reads `CLAUDE.md` for agent-specific instructions
- **Cursor**: Requires `.cursorrules` for behavior configuration
- **Windsurf**: Uses `.windsurfrules` for custom patterns
- **Aider**: Expects `.aider.conf.yml` for settings
- **GitHub Copilot**: Uses `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

This fragmentation forces teams to maintain multiple configuration files with largely duplicated content. A typical multi-tool setup requires developers to synchronize changes across 3-5 different configuration formats, increasing the risk of inconsistencies and configuration drift.

## What You Get

After installation, your CLI agent can understand commands like:

- **`hey`** - Initialize session with project status
- **`tidy up`** - Clean temporary files and caches
- **`deep clean`** - Deep cleanup with archiving
- **`check docs`** - Analyze documentation quality
- **`health check`** - Emergency diagnostics when something's wrong
- **`save work`** - Save session state and commit changes
- **`all done`** - Quick commit and push

## Features

✅ **Natural Language Commands** - Conversational interface for common tasks
✅ **Progressive Safety** - Dry-run → Modify → Reorganize
✅ **Session Management** - Context preservation across conversations
✅ **Emergency Recovery** - Diagnostic and recovery protocols
✅ **Documentation as Code** - Quality checks and auto-fixes
✅ **Git Integration** - Smart commits, checkpoints, and rollbacks

## Templates

### Minimal (5 patterns)
Basic setup with session management only. Perfect for small projects.

```bash
# After repository goes public:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aget-framework/aget/main/install.sh | bash -s . minimal

# For now, use git clone method:
git clone https://github.com/aget-framework/aget.git
cd aget-cli-agent-template
python3 installer/install.py /path/to/your/project --template minimal
```

### Standard (15+ patterns) - Recommended
Full conversational interface with housekeeping and documentation checks.

```bash
# After repository goes public:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aget-framework/aget/main/install.sh | bash

# For now, use git clone method:
git clone https://github.com/aget-framework/aget.git
cd aget-cli-agent-template
python3 installer/install.py /path/to/your/project --template standard
```

### Advanced (25+ patterns)
Everything including CI/CD integration, advanced testing, and compliance checks.

```bash
# After repository goes public:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aget-framework/aget/main/install.sh | bash -s . advanced

# For now, use git clone method:
git clone https://github.com/aget-framework/aget.git
cd aget-cli-agent-template
python3 installer/install.py /path/to/your/project --template advanced
```

## What's New in v2 (Enhanced with Real Migration Experience!)

### 🚀 Working CLI Commands
- `aget init --template [agent|tool|hybrid] --with-patterns` - One-step complete setup ✅ **ENHANCED!**
- `aget apply <pattern>` - Apply reusable patterns to your project ✅
- `aget list` - Discover available patterns ✅
- `aget rollback` - Safe rollback mechanism for configurations ✅
- `aget extract --from src/ --to products/` - Extract entire directories ✅ **ENHANCED!**
- `aget evolution --type [decision|discovery]` - Track your agent's evolution ✅

### 🎯 Major Enhancements (Based on Real Migrations)
- **One-Command Setup**: `--with-patterns` flag eliminates confusing two-step process
- **Directory Extraction**: Extract entire `src/` directories, not just single files
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintains directory hierarchy when extracting
- **94% Time Reduction**: Complete setup in <1 minute vs 15+ minutes
- **Smart Pattern Mapping**: Each template automatically applies appropriate patterns

### 📦 Template Scaffolding
- **agent**: Full autonomous agent structure with workspace/products split
- **tool**: Traditional tool/library structure
- **hybrid**: Combined agent and tool capabilities
- **minimal**: Basic configuration only
- **standard**: Default balanced template

### 🌉 Enhanced Bridge Mechanism

- Maintains package structure with proper `__init__.py` files
- Automatic secret sanitization and API key removal
- Generated setup.py and README for pip installation
- Track extractions in evolution history

### 📈 Evolution Tracking (Gate 3 Feature)
- Record decisions: `aget evolution --type decision "Why we chose X"`
- Capture discoveries: `aget evolution --type discovery "Found pattern Y"`
- Track extractions: Automatic when using `aget extract`
- View history: `aget evolution --list`

## How It Works

1. **Agent reads AGENTS.md** - Discovers available conversational command patterns
2. **Pattern discovery** - Agent automatically identifies workflow patterns from configuration
3. **Natural language triggers** - You say "hey", agent executes the corresponding pattern
4. **Safe-by-default** - Dry-run previews, rollback support, confirmation prompts
5. **Session persistence** - Context preservation across agent restarts

## Examples

### Starting a Session
```
You: hey
Agent: Running wake protocol...
       ✓ Working directory: /Users/you/project
       ✓ Git status: 3 uncommitted changes
       ✓ Tests: 47 passing
       ✓ Documentation: Grade B
       Ready for tasks.
```

### Cleaning Up
```
You: spring clean
Agent: Running spring clean protocol (dry-run)...
       Would archive 5 old session notes
       Would remove 127 __pycache__ files
       Would clean 3.2MB temp files
       Run without --dry-run to execute.
```

### Emergency Recovery
```
You: sanity check
Agent: Running emergency diagnostics...
       ✓ Python 3.11.0
       ✓ Git repository OK
       ✓ Critical files present
       ✓ Imports working
       System Status: OK
```

## Contributing

This repository implements [dogfooding practices](https://www.aget-framework.com/RKB/CLI_Agent_Template_Framework) - it uses its own patterns for self-maintenance. To contribute:

1. Fork and clone
2. Say "hey" to your CLI agent
3. Make changes following existing patterns
4. Say "test templates" to run tests
5. Say "wind down" to save your session
6. Submit a pull request

## Pattern Development

To add a new pattern:

1. Create in `patterns/<category>/<pattern_name>.py`
2. Add tests in `tests/test_<pattern_name>.py`
3. Document in `patterns/<category>/README.md`
4. Update the installer to include it

## Versioning

This project uses semantic versioning. Each pattern has its own version number, allowing selective updates.
