# Specifications Directory

## Choose Your Path

### 🔍 "I'm analyzing existing code"
→ Use templates to document what you discover
- Start with [`guides/DISCOVERING_YOUR_SPECS.md`](guides/DISCOVERING_YOUR_SPECS.md)

### 📊 "I'm working with data"
→ Use templates to document your data and insights
- Start with [`templates/DATA_SPECIFICATIONS_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/DATA_SPECIFICATIONS_TEMPLATE.md)
- Document schemas, transformations, analysis patterns

### 🚀 "I'm building something new"
→ Use templates to plan before you code
- Start with requirements first
- Let specs guide your implementation

### 🎓 "I'm learning/teaching"
→ Use templates to track understanding
- Document what each part teaches
- Track learning objectives and progress

## Templates for All Use Cases

### 📝 Templates (Start Empty, Fill As You Learn)
- [`templates/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md) - What your system does
- [`templates/BUSINESS_RULES_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/BUSINESS_RULES_TEMPLATE.md) - Why it behaves that way
- [`templates/DATA_SPECIFICATIONS_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/DATA_SPECIFICATIONS_TEMPLATE.md) - How data flows

### 📚 Guides
- [`guides/DISCOVERING_YOUR_SPECS.md`](guides/DISCOVERING_YOUR_SPECS.md) - How to reverse-engineer specifications

### 💡 Examples
Coming soon: Small examples for different project types

## For AGET Framework Development

The AGET framework's own specifications:
- [`FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_AGET.md`](FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_AGET.md) - AGET's requirements
- [`BUSINESS_RULES_AGET.md`](BUSINESS_RULES_AGET.md) - AGET's rules

For complete reference implementation, see the private `aget-aget` repository.

## Philosophy

**Your specifications should grow with your understanding:**

```
Day 1:   Empty templates → "I don't know what this does yet"
Day 7:   Partial specs → "I'm starting to understand"
Day 30:  Fuller specs → "I know how this works"
Day 90:  Complete specs → "I could rebuild this"
```

## Quick Start

1. Copy templates to your project root
2. Read the discovery guide
3. Start filling in what you know
4. Use AGET patterns to help discover more
5. Update specs as you learn

Remember: **Empty specs are better than no specs.** Start documenting what you know, even if it's just questions!
