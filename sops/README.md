# Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

This directory contains agent-specific operating procedures.

## Purpose

SOPs capture repeatable procedures that this agent performs, ensuring:
- Consistency across sessions
- Knowledge transfer between operators
- Quality assurance through documented steps

## File Naming

```
SOP_{snake_case_name}.md
```

## Creating SOPs

1. Follow `SOP_SOP_CREATION.md` if available in your KB
2. Use the SOP template from your framework version
3. Required sections: Purpose, Scope, Procedure
4. Optional sections: Checklists, Examples, Anti-Patterns

## Standard SOPs

Agents typically develop SOPs for:
- **Session protocols** - wake_up, wind_down procedures
- **Domain workflows** - role-specific procedures
- **Quality gates** - verification and validation steps
- **Handoff procedures** - cross-agent or cross-session transfers
