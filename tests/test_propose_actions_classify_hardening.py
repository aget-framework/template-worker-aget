"""Hardening pins for the REQ-PA-013 audit/synthesis classifier.

These tests exist because the pairing gate was *provably satisfiable by a write*:
`reconcile` shipped in AUDIT_VERBS, carried no synthesis verb, and therefore slipped
past CAP-PA-013-04's masquerade guard. A two-write batch on one governed artifact
returned pairing_status=PASS with has_audit=True.

Every test here asserts BOTH polarities. A one-sided pin is how the original defect
survived: the classifier's own self-test confirmed that audit verbs classify as audit
and never asked whether a non-audit verb had been mislabelled as one.

A canonical sync that reinstates `reconcile` in AUDIT_VERBS fails
test_reconcile_alone_is_not_audit. That is the point.
