      small: "2-3 gates — low risk, straightforward"
      medium: "4-6 gates — moderate risk or multi-step"
      large: "7+ gates — high risk, irreversible operations, broad impact"

  # --- Execution Discipline ---

  # CAP-GP-007: Gate Execution Discipline
  CAP-GP-007:
    pattern: ubiquitous
    domain: execution
    statement: "System SHALL execute only current gate deliverables, stop at gate boundary, run validation checks, and wait for explicit GO before starting next gate"
    rationale: "L42 establishes that gate discipline prevents scope creep and ensures quality"
    red_flags:
      - "'While we are at it, let us also...' — likely next gate work"
      - "Optimizing for speed over control"
      - "Assuming continuation without explicit GO"
    validation:
      - "Gate plan includes L42 discipline section"

      - "Decision point is phrased as specific question"
      - "Decision point includes GO/NOGO options"
    based_on: "L42"

  # --- Compliance and Verification ---

  # CAP-GP-009: Process Compliance Checklist
  CAP-GP-009:
    pattern: ubiquitous
    domain: compliance
    statement: "System SHALL include Process_Compliance_Checklist verifying gate structure against mandatory framework patterns"
    rationale: "L551 discovered that plans without compliance checklists skip process requirements"
    checklist_items:
      - "Spec precedes implementation? (L533)"
      - "Gate ordering follows Spec-Validate-Implement-Verify? (L546)"
      - "Propagation gate included if fleet-wide? (L541/L328)"

    based_on: "L551 (Due Diligence Process Compliance)"

  # CAP-GP-010: Spec Basis per Gate
  CAP-GP-010:
    pattern: ubiquitous
    domain: compliance
    statement: "System SHALL declare a Spec_Basis for every Gate in a Gate_Plan"
    rationale: |
      Inherited from CAP-PP-013. Gate plans are equally susceptible to
      certainty-bias: gate deliverables without spec basis default to
      'obviously correct' assumptions.
    validation:
      - "Every gate section contains a 'Spec Basis:' field"
      - "Field references at least one existing spec, L-doc, or template"
      - "References resolve (named artifacts exist)"
    anti_patterns:
      - "Gate with deliverables but no spec basis"
      - "'Common sense' or 'obvious' as justification"
    based_on: "L555, CAP-PP-013"

  # CAP-GP-011: Pre-Submission Verification
  CAP-GP-011:
    pattern: event-driven
    domain: compliance
    statement: "WHEN presenting Gate_Plan to principal, System SHALL verify factual claims against ground truth"
    rationale: |
      Inherited from CAP-PP-014. Gate plans contain factual claims
      (effort estimates, risk assessments, dependency references) that
      can be stale or inaccurate. Verification before presentation
      catches errors.
    components:
      - "Verify quantitative claims (counts, percentages, references)"
      - "Verify dependency references resolve"
      - "Correct mismatches before presenting"
    validation:
      - "Factual claims verified before presenting to principal"
      - "Mismatches corrected or noted"
    based_on: "L558, CAP-PP-014"

  # --- Risk and Recovery ---

  # CAP-GP-012: Risk Assessment
  CAP-GP-012:
    pattern: ubiquitous
    domain: risk
    statement: "System SHALL identify risks with impact, mitigation, and contingency for every Gate_Plan"
    rationale: "Risk assessment enables proactive prevention and reduces gate failure"
    risk_structure:
      - "Description: What could go wrong"
      - "Impact: Effect if occurs"
      - "Mitigation: How to prevent"
      - "Contingency: Rollback plan if needed"
    validation:
      - "Risk Assessment section exists"
      - "At least 1 risk identified (gate plans are simpler than project plans)"
      - "High-impact risks have mitigation and contingency"
    based_on: "CAP-PP-008, GATE_PLAN_TEMPLATE v1.0"

  # CAP-GP-013: Rollback Strategy
  CAP-GP-013:
    pattern: conditional
    domain: risk
    statement: "IF Gate_Plan contains gates with irreversible operations THEN System SHALL include Rollback_Strategy section with per-gate rollback procedure and verification"
    rationale: |
      Inherited from CAP-PP-015. L554 found 100% of plans lacked rollback.
      Gate plans involving file modifications, deployments, or state mutations
      need explicit rollback procedures.
    components:
      - "Rollback Strategy section (dedicated)"
      - "Table columns: Gate, Risk Level, Rollback Procedure, Verification"
      - "One row per gate with Medium or High risk"
      - "N/A permitted only with explicit rationale"
    validation:
      - "Rollback Strategy section present when plan has irreversible ops"
      - "Every High/Medium risk gate has rollback row"
      - "Rollback procedures are specific commands"
      - "Verification column has executable check"
    based_on: "L554, CAP-PP-015"

  # --- Success and Completion ---

  # CAP-GP-014: Success Criteria
  CAP-GP-014:
    pattern: ubiquitous
    domain: planning
    statement: "System SHALL define measurable Success_Criteria and Quality_Bar for every Gate_Plan"
    rationale: "Success criteria enable objective completion assessment"
    components:
      - "Overall Objectives: Specific measurable outcomes (checkboxes)"
      - "Quality Bar: Target (done well) and Minimum (acceptable)"
    validation:
      - "Success Criteria section exists"
      - "At least 2 measurable objectives defined"
      - "Quality Bar has both Target and Minimum"
    based_on: "CAP-PP-007, GATE_PLAN_TEMPLATE v1.0"

  # CAP-GP-015: Post-Completion
  CAP-GP-015:
    pattern: event-driven
    domain: planning
    statement: "WHEN completing Gate_Plan, System SHALL capture learnings and document follow-up work"
    rationale: "Post-completion prevents learning loss and orphaned follow-up items"
    components:
      - "Learning Capture: Create L-doc if generalizable pattern revealed"
      - "Follow-Up Work: Enhancements or tasks deferred for later"
    validation:
      - "Post-Completion section exists"
      - "Learning capture decision documented (created L-doc or 'no generalizable pattern')"
      - "Follow-up work listed or 'none identified'"
    based_on: "CAP-PP-010, GATE_PLAN_TEMPLATE v1.0"

  # CAP-GP-016: Scope Exclusion Tracking
  CAP-GP-016:
    pattern: event-driven
    domain: compliance
    statement: "WHEN declaring items Explicitly_Excluded in Scope_Decision, System SHALL document reason for each exclusion"
    rationale: |
      Lighter version of CAP-PP-016 (Out-of-Scope Tracking). Gate plans
      use 'Explicitly Excluded' with reasons rather than full tracking
      tables, since gate plans are shorter-lived and lower-risk than
      project plans.
    validation:
      - "Each excluded item has a reason"
      - "Significant excluded items reference follow-up (issue or plan)"
    anti_patterns:
      - "Excluded items with no reason"
      - "Excluding critical items without follow-up reference"
    based_on: "L274, CAP-PP-016"

notes: |
  This specification formalizes GATE_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md into EARS format.

  Key design decisions:
  - 16 capabilities (vs 17 in parent PROJECT_PLAN_SPEC) — gate plans are simpler
  - Lighter requirements where appropriate (1 risk vs 3, optional learning vs required)
  - Inherits L555/L558/L554 enforcement from parent spec (CAP-GP-010/011/013)
  - Scope exclusion tracking is lighter than project plan out-of-scope tracking
  - No OKR framework (gate plans use Success Criteria instead)
  - No hypothesis section (gate plans rarely test hypotheses)

  Relationship to parent spec:
  - CAP-GP-010 inherits from CAP-PP-013 (Spec Basis)
  - CAP-GP-011 inherits from CAP-PP-014 (Pre-Submission Verification)
  - CAP-GP-013 inherits from CAP-PP-015 (Rollback Strategy)
  - CAP-GP-016 inherits from CAP-PP-016 (Out-of-Scope Tracking, lighter version)

  Template compliance: GATE_PLAN_TEMPLATE v1.0 predates this spec.
  Known gaps: No Spec Basis field, no Pre-Submission Verification section.
  Template update tracked as follow-on work.
